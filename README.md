#This is a readme file for my new Journey towards mastering python. I've started his journey before now,but subsequently fell at the way. Well am starting all over.
Dr Patrick Charles Severance will be my tutor, I also have another tutor at Educative.io..
This folder will contain my work of proof towards mastery, Chapters and projects carried out during the long phase of learning Python Language..
Each and every thing learned, I shall edit this file as time goes on.
#Thanks to alx for introducing me to Git and Github, even though I couldn't go pass the probation phase,lol.
